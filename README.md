## Electric Dipole Field

A small step toward visual representation of electric fields.
This project explores the electric field of a dipole through numerical computation
and 2D visualization in Python, with explicit rendering of the point charges
that generate the field.

The implementation uses Coulomb’s law to compute the electric field on a 2D grid
and visualizes both the field lines and the charge positions for clearer physical
interpretation.

## Current features

- Electric field computation for a point-charge dipole
- 2D streamplot visualization of electric field lines
- Explicit visualization of positive and negative charges
- Correctly defined spatial domain and aspect ratio

## Planned features

- Improved documentation and code clarity
- Animated electric field visualization

## Next steps

- [ ] Add inline comments and docstrings
- [ ] Refactor field computation for clarity and reuse
- [ ] Implement animated field representation
